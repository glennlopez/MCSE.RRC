Scripts
---

These scripts were made specifically for removing the "busy-work" out of lab configurations. Do not use these if you do not know how to manually configure the labs yourself. The scripts WILL remove you from the experiance of learning how to properly and manually configure anything related to MSCE. My intent for making these scripts were to teach myself how to write Batch files for Windows, these scripts should not be used for cheating.
