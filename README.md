This repo is where I keep all my MCSE coursework. MCSE (Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer) is about the Microsoft Windows NT operating system, related desktop systems, networking, and Microsoft's BackOffice server products. It's widely recognized by employers as the highest level of certification you could achieve in Microsoft operating systems.
